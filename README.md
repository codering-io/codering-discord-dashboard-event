# Code Ring Event

## Saturday, Monday 10th 12 PM EST - Monday, August 24th 12 PM EST

## Synopsis

### MERN

- This event requires users to collaborate with each other and build a full stack application using:
  - MongoDB
  - Express.js
  - React
  - Node.js
- The goal is to build a working CRUD application that meets all requirements listed below.
- The top contributor will win a $50 Amazon Gift Card (x2 last event)

## Getting Started

- There are a total of ??? tasks. You are only allowed to submit *one* task ***per*** pull request. You may submit a new Pull Request once yours is closed or merged. For example, you cannot submit 1 Pull Request with both tasks 1) and 2) together.

- Do not install any additional modules, the only npm packages needed are already listed in the package.json

- Fork this repository, and then clone your own fork either with HTTP or SSH

- Run `npm i`

- To start the express backend, run `npm run start` to start the app, or if you have nodemon, `npm run dev`. This will start up the express app on Port 3001.

- Start up the react application by running `npm run start`. This automatically sets up a live testing environment in your default browser on port 3000.

- Please make sure you have Node.JS Installed, all of the required package dependencies, as well as MongoDB running on Port 27017.

## How to contribute

You must fork this repository, and then clone it and then make changes on your own fork. When you push, you will have your changes reflected on **your** fork only, not our repository. You must create a pull request *into* the master branch of this repository. Once you've successfully created a pull request, be sure to verify it was created on the repository.

## Requirements

- This project must have a discord bot with the following customizable features:
  - Auto role (role to be given when user joins)
  - Change Bot Prefix
  - Change MUTED role (role that when given mutes)
- This project must have the following (api) endpoints:
  - **/prefix**
  - **/roles/autorole**
  - **/roles/mutedrole**

## Explanation

## Restrictions

- Do not create multiple pull requests. You can only have 1 opened pull request at all times.
- You can only create a pull request with code that corresponds to only ONE feature. So, you cannot code the entire project and make a PR. Doing this will disqualify you from the event immediately.
